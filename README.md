## Abstract
This project addresses the limitations of conventional text-based search in e-commerce by introducing an innovative image-based search engine. The primary challenge lies in the diverse ways customers express product preferences and their occasional inability to articulate precise names. Our solution leverages the power of visual search, enabling users to find products effortlessly through images. By transcending language barriers and accommodating varied expressions, the image-based search promises to revolutionize the user experience, providing a more accurate and inclusive platform for online shopping.
